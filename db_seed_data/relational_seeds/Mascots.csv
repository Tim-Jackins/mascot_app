He is about 7â€™2â€ and weighs 1 dyno-to.

Dinger hatched on April 16th 1994.  The Colorado Rockies were still building Coors Field so, they decided to dig a special cave for their new mascot.

Now Dinger lives at Coors Field and does a great job cheering for the Rockies, entertaining the crowd, and giving hugs and kisses to Rockies Fans young and old. 
If you look around you can find Dinger all over Colorado and the Rocky Mountains! Some of the things Dinger likes to do are: dancing, playing baseball, volunteering in the community, riding bikes, eating lots of outfield grass and peanuts, and much much more!
But, no matter where Dinger goes, he always loves returning to the home that was built for him at beautiful Coors Field.

Dinger has been the Colorado Rockies biggest fan since he first hatched from his egg at Mile High Stadium on April 16, 1994. Dinger works year-round promoting physical fitness and literacy for thousands of elementary school students in the Rocky Mountain Region. He acts out his own Dinger Story for the kids.

6,Wally the Green Monster,3,13-Apr-97,,,"His name is derived from the Green Monster nickname of the 37-foot (11 m) wall in left field at Fenway Park. Wally debuted in 1997 to the chagrin of many older Red Sox fans, despite his popularity with children.

According to the Red Sox promotions department, Wally was a huge Red Sox fan who, in 1947, decided to move inside the left field wall of Fenway Park, since it ""eats up"" hits that would easily be home runs at other parks. Apparently, he was very shy and lived the life of a hermit for 50 years. In 1997, on the 50th anniversary of the Green Monster being painted green, he came out of the manual scoreboard and has been interacting with players and fans ever since.[22]

When the team began to grow out their beards as a trademark during their 2013 World Series run, Wally was given a long beard as well.

In January 2016, the Red Sox unveiled a new mascot named Tessie, Wally the Green Monster's little sister.[23] Tessie is named after the song ""Tessie"", which has long been associated with the Red Sox.[24][25]",0,C:\MHOF\MLB Images\bos_mascot.jpg,,1,,7,,1,,,,

8,Gapper,25,06-Dec-02,,,"Gapper is one of the current mascots for the Cincinnati Reds.[9] He was first introduced as the furry companion to Mr. Red, the long-time mascot in the winter of 2002 as the franchise was preparing to move to their new home, Great American Ball Park. The mascot was created by David Raymond's Raymond Entertainment Group, the founder being the man inside the Phillie Phanatic costume from 1973 to 1993. A young fan won two season tickets for submitting the winning name; he is named after the ""gap"" in the stands in the seats of Great American, which provides a view into and out of the stadium. The term ""gapper"" is also a slang phrase for a batted ball which falls into the ""gap"" between outfielders (generally a ball hit to either left-center or right-center field which rolls to the fence). According to a recent cincinnati.com poll of the Red's four mascots, he is the least popular amongst fans. He received 6% of the voting, Mr. Red received 23%, Rosie Red received 34%, and Mr. Redlegs received 47%.",0,C:\MHOF\MLB Images\cin_mascot.jpg,,1,1,7,,1,"Hire within, typically from our promo team.",,,

He wears a Tigers hat and jersey; in previous years, Paws' jersey would have the current season's 2 digit abbreviation (i.e. '10 for 2010). However, in 2011 and 2016, Paws' number changed to 00, since the Tigers retired #11 and #16 in honor of Sparky Anderson and Hal Newhouser, respectively.

11,Sluggerr,8,05-Apr-96,,01-Jan-17,"The lion whose mane looks like a crown made his debut on April 5, 1996. The word slugger also refers to a powerful batter with a high percentage of extra base hits. Sluggerrr is one of few mascots that has Facebook and Twitter accounts, both clearly marked on his homepage.

In 2010, Sluggerrr was sued by a man named John Coomer for allegedly firing a hotdog at his eye, while the mascot was shooting hotdogs into the stands. The Royals later fired the current man behind Sluggerrr and replaced him.[20]

In 2017, Sluggerrr was inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame.",0,C:\MHOF\MLB Images\kc_mascot.jpg,,1,3,6,3,1,,,,
12,Billy the Marlin,17,01-Apr-93,,,"Resembling a marlin with limbs, he can be seen at every Marlins home game. He competes in a waterboat race, which is a computer-animated video shown on the screen, during each game. The name, picked by original team owner Wayne Huizenga, is derived from the fact that a marlin is a billfish, and Huizenga wanted a name that was different from the baseball type names of other mascots (like Slider and Sluggerrr) and one that children could remember more easily. On Mothers Day and Father's Day, Billy is joined by his parents, Bill Sr. and Betty the Marlin. Billy is also seen at games dancing with kids on the field in between innings and making special appearances in the Fan Zone.

On Opening Day of 1997, the year the Marlins won their first World Series Championship, a Navy SEAL who was parachuting into Hard Rock Stadium (then known as Pro Player Stadium) as Billy, lost the head in mid-air. While the crowd was unaware of the problem, media outlets had been alerted to Billy's parachute entrance. When he didn't arrive, the media ran with the story, getting national attention and leading to ESPN's Dan Patrick's nightly quote, ""Bring me the head of Billy the Marlin!""

The original Billy The Marlin was John Routh, who spent 10 years (1993–2002) entertaining Marlins fans.[2] Routh previously portrayed the University of Miami mascots, Sebastian the Ibis and The Miami Maniac from 1983–1993, and prior to that, Cocky for the University of South Carolina Gamecocks",0,C:\MHOF\MLB Images\mia_mascot.jpg,,1,,11,,1,,,,
13,Bernie Brewer,22,01-Apr-93,,,"The Bernie Brewer character became the team's mascot in 1973, appearing as a cheerful man with a big mustache. A beer-barreled chalet was built for him inside the stadium where he led the crowd cheering. Following each home run and every victory by the Brewers, he would slide down and plunge himself into a huge beer mug in celebration. He was joined by a companion Bonnie Brewer, who would playfully swat at the backside of the opposing team's third base coach with a broom as the field crew swept the base paths.

Bernie Brewer was a fixture at Brewers home games until 1984, when the Brewers re-built the bleachers, replacing the chalet with a sound tower and sending Bernie into retirement. By popular demand, Bernie Brewer came out of his retirement in 1993, when the fans voted for his return. Bernie was brought back not as just a mustachioed man in lederhosen, but a full-body costume of a man, including large foam head. The chalet was then rebuilt (it had been in storage on the third base side under the box seats) above the left-center field bleachers. The original beer mug that Bernie used to slide into is still in Milwaukee, Wisconsin as part of the Lakefront Brewery, Inc. tour.",0,C:\MHOF\MLB Images\mil_mascot.jpg,,3,,3,,1,,,,
14,Stomper,15,01-Jan-97,,,"Stomper is the mascot of the Oakland Athletics. Created in 1997, he is an elephant who wears an A's uniform adorned with the number 00. Stomper has performed at several All-Star Games and has appeared in a Public Service Announcement discouraging the use of chewing tobacco.

The use of an elephant to symbolize the A's dates back to the early years of the franchise, when a group of Philadelphia businessmen, headed by industrialist Benjamin Shibe, became the team's first owners. When asked to comment, John McGraw, manager of the New York Giants of the rival National League, said something to the effect that ""Shibe had bought himself a white elephant."" In response, A's manager (and future owner) Connie Mack selected the elephant as the team symbol and mascot. From time to time an illustration of an elephant has been featured on the Athletics uniform, including from 1988 to the present.

Name: Stomper
Height: 6' 6""
Weight: A ton of fun!

15,The Pirate Parrot,24,01-Apr-79,,,"The Pirate Parrot debuted in 1979. He is a large green parrot who wears a Pirates jersey and cap. The character of a parrot was derived from the classic story Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson, most notably the one owned by Long John Silver named ""Captain Flint"". He is often seen dancing on the dugouts and shooting hot-dogs from a cannon.",0,C:\MHOF\MLB Images\pit_mascot.jpg,,1,,10,20,1,,,,
16,The Swinging Friar,29,01-Jan-00,,,"The Swinging Friar has been a mascot with the team as early as 1958, when the Padres were still a member of the Pacific Coast League, a minor league baseball organization. He was named after the Spanish Franciscan friars, who founded the Mission San Diego de Alcalá, around which the city of San Diego began to emerge in the 18th century. The Padres joined Major League Baseball in 1969 and kept the popular mascot. He was even on the team emblem until 1984. Wanting a more ""professional"" image, the owners introduced a more corporate logo. In 1996, he was brought back as a sleeve patch for the club's blue alternate jerseys, and though the team has changed its logo and colors since then, the Friar remains there to this day.

The Swinging Friar is a cartoon-like character, pudgy, balding, and always smiling. He is dressed as a friar with a tonsure, sandals, a dark hooded cloak, and a rope around the waist. He swings a baseball bat; but reportedly, in some years he swings left-handed, in other years he swings right-handed, he may be ambidextrous, or even a switch hitter. On home game Sundays, the Friar wears a special camouflage cloak as the team honors the military background of San Diego with similar uniforms. The Friar also rings a mission bell at home games immediately after a win.

Originally, The Swinging Friar was represented at the ballpark as a real man wearing a friar outfit. Since his return, the character has been a full mascot costume.

Some in the past have confused The San Diego Chicken as the mascot of the Padres. Although he does make appearances occasionally at San Diego sporting events, he has never been the official mascot of any San Diego sports team.",0,C:\MHOF\MLB Images\sd_mascot.jpg,,3,,3,,1,,,,
17,Lou Seal,30,25-Jul-96,,,"""Born"" on July 25, 1996, Luigi Francisco Seal[10] has been a regular part of all Giants home games, as well as numerous events in San Francisco and around the United States, ever since. Although his name (a play on the name ""Lucille"") is a bit ambiguous, he is indeed ""officially"" male and the person inside the costume is a man.[11] Species-wise, Lou Seal is a reference to the San Francisco Seals, the baseball club that was a mainstay of the Pacific Coast League from 1903 until 1957.

In a contest held by the Giants where fans were asked for ideas, six people submitted the name ""Lou Seal."" These lucky fans were then invited to a game that season where they sat in a luxury box and got to meet the newly named mascot, and one of them was randomly chosen to throw out the first pitch. In 2008 Forbes Magazine named Lou Seal the best mascot in sports.[citation needed] He has had 1,150 consecutive home-game appearances,[12] and is one of the four subjects followed in the second season of the Hulu series Behind the Mask.[13]

Lou Seal also made occasional appearances at the Giants' High-A minor league team, the San Jose Giants. This practice ended in 2006 when the San Jose Giants introduced their own mascot named Gigante.",0,C:\MHOF\MLB Images\sfg_mascot.jpg,,1,,13,,1,,,,
18,The Mariner Moose,13,13-Apr-90,,,"In 1990, a contest for children 14 and under was held to select a mascot, after 2500 entries the club chose the ""Mariner Moose"" The Moose made his debut on April 13, 1990 dancing on the field at the Kingdome. During the 1995 American League Division Series between the M's and the New York Yankees, the Moose gained national attention when he broke his ankle crashing into the outfield wall at the Kingdome while being towed on inline skates behind an ATV in the outfield. Inline skating behind an ATV would continue to be a fan favorite until 1999, when the team moved to Safeco Field and a natural grass playing surface. Since then, the Moose has become quite adept at driving his own ATV around Safeco Field's warning track while performing various tricks and having water coolers emptied on him by bullpen pitchers.

The Moose makes several hundred appearances in the community each year in addition to Mariners home games, at everything from hospitals to wedding receptions. The Mariner Moose was featured on the ballot for the Mascot Hall of Fame in 2006 and 2007. He also nearly ran over Coco Crisp with his ATV in 2007, raising the ire of Red Sox pitching coach John Farrell.",0,C:\MHOF\MLB Images\sea_mascot.jpg,,1,,14,,1,,,,
19,Fred Bird,23,09-Apr-79,,,"He is an anthropomorphic cardinal wearing the team's uniform. A person dressed up as Fredbird can often be found entertaining young children during baseball games at Busch Stadium. His name is derived from ""Redbird"", a synonym for the cardinal bird and for the Cardinals themselves.

Fredbird was introduced in 1979 by the Cardinals, then owned by Anheuser-Busch, to entertain younger fans at the games. He quickly became popular with fans for his dancing, habit of ""beaking"" the heads of supporters, and for throwing T-shirts into the stands. In later years, he has been joined by ""Team Fredbird"", a group of young women employed by the club who help him with his T-shirt toss and occasionally in other duties.

Rangers Captain has multiple uniforms to match each of the variants the team has; his chosen uniform for the game matches the uniform choice made by the team for that particular game. However, his outfit sometimes matches a theme the team is promoting; as an example, on April 24, 2010, he dressed up like Elvis Presley as part of an Elvis theme promotional night.",0,C:\MHOF\MLB Images\tex_mascot.jpg,,1,,1,,1,,,,
22,Ace,5,01-Apr-02,,,"He, along with his female counterpart, ""Diamond"" replaced former mascot BJ Birdie before the 2002 season as a mascot duo. Like his predecessor, Ace resembles a large blue jay. The mascot's name is baseball slang for a team's top starting pitcher (the ""ace"" of the staff, such as former Blue Jays pitcher Roy Halladay).

In 2004, Ace became the sole mascot of the team after Diamond was removed by the Blue Jays prior to the start of the season. In 2011, Blue Jays fans were introduced to his younger brother Junior (see below).",0,C:\MHOF\MLB Images\tor_mascot.jpg,,1,,10,22,1,,,,

The mascot was created by Brantley Bell (who is currently an infielder for the Ole Miss Rebels baseball team), the son of Jay Bell, one of the players on the Diamondbacks 1998 inaugural season roster. Brantley came up with the name from two sources. ""D. Baxter"" comes from the team's nickname, ""the D-Backs"". The bobcat is from the original name of the stadium where the Diamondbacks play.

59,Viktor,85,01-Jan-07,,,"January 28th, 960 AD marked the birth of one of the greatest Vikings to live in the Norseman Age.  Some say he was kin to Thor, the Thunder God himself.  These rumors proved true once Thor bestowed the legendary war hammer, Mjolnir upon the young man.  Unfortunately, this Vikingâ€™s tale was lost amidst the breaking surf of the mighty Atlantic Ocean over a thousand years ago.  That is until 2007 when the mystery was finally revealedâ€¦

This legend takes us back to the height of Viking power.  Thorâ€™s chosen Viking hero had set out across the ocean in search of new western lands.  Thorâ€™s father, the chief god Odin, was enraged at Thorâ€™s assistance to mere mortals and sought to destroy them with a violent storm.   A thick, dark blanket of clouds wrapped tightly around the seas of the North Atlantic while streaks of lightning illuminated the desperate scene.  Cold, wet spray tore into the faces of hardened Viking warriors as they wielded massive oars.  Dressed in full battle armor, brandishing the mighty Mjolnir, Viktor the Viking stood in complete disregard of the tempest.  He was renowned for his strength and courage, and his own men faithfully followed him into the murky abyss.  In the end, the tiny ship was blown far off course and deep into the Great Lakes of the North American continent.  Here, the vessel finally submitted to Odinâ€™s fury as Viktor and his Viking brethren were lost to a cyclone of swirling water and foam. 

However, at the frigid bottom of Lake Superior, Thor encased Viktor in ice to await the time when he would thaw and fulfill his destiny.  That time was the summer of 2007.  After thawing on the shores of Lake Superior, Viktor heard rumors of purple clad Vikings that engaged in battle every Sunday.  Thrilled at this news, Viktor raced south to these Vikings of the gridiron and a place called Winter Park. 

When he finally arrived, he was surprised to learn that these Vikings battled in a game called football.  Determined to once again be a hero amongst his Viking brethren, he set out to join the team.  However, having never played the game severely hindered his chances.  In the end, he did not make the official team roster and would have to wait another year to tryout.  Despite this decision, the team asked Viktor to remain a part of the organization as the official team mascot.  They knew his spirit and willingness to support the team would be invaluable.  Viktor was overjoyed to accept.  After all, how much demand is there for a thousand year old Viking warrior skilled in the arts of pillaging and plundering?  So, today Viktor can be found on the sidelines cheering his beloved Viking teammates on to VIKTORY!!!",0,c:\MHOF\NFL Images\vikings_nfl.jpg,,3,25,3,,1,,,,

Cocky is most known for his iconic 2001 Magic Box entrance. The spectacular entrance can be seen at every home football game when the Gamecocks take the field. Cocky can be seen hyping up the crowd with his fan favorite beak flap and more not only at football games, but at men's and women's basketball, volleyball, men's and women's soccer, baseball, softball, swimming, golf, track, and tennis events as well. Cocky is also a staple around the community. A spectacular program known as Cocky’s Reading Express allows Cocky to promote literacy across schools throughout the state. Students read to children, and Cocky helps the children understand the importance of life-long reading. The children are given a book to take home, a reminder of their visit from Cocky. Overall Cocky represents what it means to be a Gamecock and is instantly recognizable face of our great University.

107,Aubie the Tiger,95,28-Feb-79,,01-Jan-06,"Aubie, Auburn University's tiger mascot, is in his 40th season as a spirit leader and goodwill ambassador for Auburn University. A popular character among Auburn fans and one of the most animated mascots in the country, Aubie is the living spirit of Auburn. 

Aubie has very animated characteristics such as his strut walk, quick turns, and exaggerated pointing. His style is to mix tiger and human traits such as using props, riding a moped, leading the band, and performing clownish pranks. Aubie made his debut in 1979 and is a popular beloved character among Auburn fans and one of the more animated mascots in the country.

Aubie has won a record nine mascot national championships (his latest coming in 2016). Aubie was named the 2014 Capital One Mascot of the Year and was among the first three collegiate mascots inducted to the Mascot Hall of Fame on August 15, 2006.

108,Bucky Badger,123,01-Jan-40,,01-Jan-06,"The as-yet unnamed Wisconsin mascot appeared as a human-like cartoon figure in University of Wisconsin publications in the 1930s.[1] The most familiar portrayal of Bucky Badger, wearing a ""W"" sweater and strutting forward with a fierce expression, was drawn by California-based commercial artist Art Evans in 1940, and first sold from Brown's Book Store in Madison.[2][3] A popular version of Bucky sporting boxing gloves was first drawn by hometown Madison artist Thomas Spiece.[4] An actual badger from Eau Claire was used at the first few football games that year, but proved to be too fierce to be controlled properly and was retired to the nearby Henry Vilas Zoo. After that, the school replaced the live badger with a live raccoon named Regdab ('badger' backwards). In 1948, a UW-Madison art student, Carolyn (Connie) Conrad was asked to create a paper-mache Bucky head-piece. A UW-Madison Gymnast and cheerleader, Bill Sagal, wore the outfit at the homecoming game and a contest was started to properly name the mascot. The winning entry was Buckingham U. Badger. Bucky has been maintained over the years, even surviving a threat by the assistant attorney general, Howard Koop, who suggested that Bucky be replaced by Henrietta Holstein, a loveable cow.

In 2006, Bucky was inducted as a charter member of the Mascot Hall of Fame's College Division, joining YoUDee from Delaware, Sparty from the Michigan State University, and Aubie from Auburn.",0,c:\mhof\DIV-I\Big 10 Images\badger.jpg,,1,,23,,1,,,,
109,YoUDee,124,06-Sep-18,,01-Jan-06,"YoUDee (pronounced yoo-dee) is the official mascot of the University of Delaware. YoUDee is an androgynous ""fighting Blue Hen"" and is named after the state bird of Delaware.

According to the University of Delaware, YoUDee's great-great-great-grandfather, Col. George W. YoUDee, distinguished himself in the American Revolutionary War and was cited for bravery in battle. Capt. John Caldwell, commenting after the Battle of Trenton, said, ""There's no yellow streak in that chicken. He's blue to the bone."" Col. YoUDee was given a gold medal of valor, so blue and yellow-gold now serve as YoUDee's official colors. The men in the company commanded by Captain Jonathan Caldwell actually carried Blue Hens with them into combat in order to hold cockfights in their spare time. It is said that the men under Capt. Caldwell fought so bravely that they were compared to their fighting blue hens.

YoUDee is 6 feet, 8 inches, from the soles of his blue and yellow sneakers to the top of his comb. YoUDee's chest is 64 inches. YoUDee also has a wingspan of 6 feet, 1 inch and a tailspan of 5 feet, 6 inches. Careful breeding has produced beautiful plumage of PMS #300c blue feathers, particularly striking in YoUDee's broad, sweeping tail. YoUDee wears Air YoUDees on its feet. YoUDee's stylish size 28FF blue and yellow sneakers help it soar through the air with hangtime measured in minutes. 

YoUDee was created by Real Characters Inc. (RCI) of Atlanta. Tom Sapp, chairman and creative director, was in charge of design. He also designed a line of YoUDee artwork for apparel and other items, on sale at the University Bookstore and other outlets. Real Character Productions Inc., an affiliate of RCI, handcrafted the three-dimensional mascot using Scott foam, Antron fleece, medical-quality plastics and a variety of special materials. Keith Bailey was the chief designer and led a design team including Chris Heine and Dixie Harris.

YoUDee won its first Universal Cheerleaders Association mascot national championship in 2001 and has won seven overall, its latest coming in 2017. YoUDee was inducted into the inaugural class of the Mascot Hall of Fame on August 16, 2006 in a ceremony at Philadelphia's LOVE Park.

112,Lil' Red,127,01-Jan-94,,01-Jan-07,"Lil' Red is one of two mascots representing University of Nebraska–Lincoln's athletic teams. Lil' Red is the newest mascot, having been created for the 1993 season after a statewide contest run for that purpose. Associate athletic director Dr. Barbara Hibner was the driving force behind Lil' Red.[3]

Lil' Red can be seen on the sideline at Nebraska college football games at Memorial Stadium, along with other university sporting venues such as Pinnacle Bank Arena during basketball games and at the Bob Devaney Sports Center for volleyball matches. The mascot is currently produced by Signs & Shapes International, Inc. based in Omaha, Nebraska. The operator of the costume wears a ""PowerBelt,"" a belt with an air circulation system, which brings in over 100 cubic feet (2.8 m3) of fresh outside air per minute, enough fresh air to accommodate roughly 1,000 people. Due to the mascot's incredibly light weight, the larger-than-life mascot can run, dance, crowd surf and shake hands.

Since its installment, Lil' Red has won the national championship at the NCAA National Mascot Competition in 1999, and was inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame in 2007, which selected its winners by an online vote.[4]

The costume was designed to appeal to children and has become a recognizable piece of Nebraska athletics culture.",0,c:\mhof\DIV-I\Big 10 Images\nulilred.jpg,,3,,3,,1,,,,
113,Nittany Lion,128,01-Jan-04,,01-Jan-17,"The Nittany Lion is the mascot of Pennsylvania State University in University Park, Pennsylvania, USA and its athletic teams. There is a song played during sporting events on campus entitled ""The Nittany Lion."" Fans know this song as Hail to the Lion, even though that is not technically the name of the song.

The Nittany Lion mascot pumps up the crowd at the 2005 football game versus Cincinnati at Beaver Stadium.
The mascot was the creation of Penn State senior H. D. ""Joe"" Mason in 1907 since the Nittany Lion is not a real animal. While on a 1904 trip to Princeton University, Mason had been embarrassed that Penn State did not have a mascot. Mason did not let that deter him: he fabricated the Nittany Lion on the spot and proclaimed that it would easily defeat the Princeton Bengal tiger.[1] The Lion's primary means of attack against the Tiger would be its strong right arm, capable of slaying any foes (this is now traditionally exemplified through one-armed push-ups after the team scores a touchdown). Upon returning to campus, he set about making his invention a reality. In 1907, he wrote in the student publication The Lemon:

“	Every college the world over of any consequence has a college emblem of some kind—all but The Pennsylvania State College . . .. Why not select for ours the king of beasts—the Lion!! Dignified, courageous, magnificent, the Lion allegorically represents all that our College Spirit should be, so why not 'the Nittany Mountain Lion'? Why cannot State have a kingly, all-conquering Lion as the eternal sentinel?	”
[2]

Mountain lions had roamed on nearby Mount Nittany until the 1880s.[2] The origin of the name ""Mount Nittany"" is obscure, the most commonly accepted explanation being that it is derived of Native American words (loosely pronounced as ""neet-a-nee"") named after the cougars that roamed the mountain or ""single mountain"" - a protective barrier against the elements.[citation needed]. The ""original"" nittany lion can be seen in the Penn State All-Sports Museum as the only known mounted eastern mountain lion. It was killed in Susquehanna County by Samuel Brush in 1856.[3] According to a July 1992 article in National Geographic by Maurice Hornocker titled ""Learning to Live with Mountain Lions"", ""Courthouse records from Centre County, Pennsylvania, show that one local hunter killed 64 lions between 1820 and 1845. During those 25 years an estimated 600 cats were killed in that county alone.""",0,c:\mhof\DIV-I\Big 10 Images\Penn_State_Nittany_Lion.jpg,,1,,6,3,1,,,,

133,Gnash,161,01-Sep-98,,,"In 1971, it was believed that no archaeological find would ever match their recent discovery. Then in 1994, while digging the foundations for the new Nashville Arena (now called Bridgestone Arena), an even greater discovery was made. Deep beneath the surface, down where the earth is cold and dark, the drills and jackhammers unearthed a beast, a baby saber-tooth tiger, completely frozen in a huge block of ice. The site had obviously been undisturbed for years.

Rather than subject the creature to an existence of endless scientific research and study living in a cage, they looked for a place where he could feel at home. The cat would need a place that felt like a cave, where he would hear the familiar roar of his own kind. And, above all else, he needed ice!

The crew placed the frozen cub in the center of the arena to thaw. When they returned the next morning, the ice had melted and the creature was gone. They searched for days, but never found him. They feared that he was gone forever, but they were wrong. The little beast had gone in search of other tigers in this strange new world.

After several years, he had given up hope of ever finding any of his kind again. Then on Oct. 10, 1998, he heard the familiar roar of other saber-tooth tigers. What he found were Predators fans cheering their team on Opening Night. He had found a home.

Now all grown up, the huge beast lives in the dark corners of Bridgestone Arena, and only comes out of hiding when he hears the familiar Predators roar that reminds him of home.",0,c:\mhof\nhl images\gnash.jpg,https://www.nhl.com/predators/fans/gnash,1,20,6,9,1,,One Performer,,

growing up. He’s a fun-loving child at heart – one reason he interacts so well with kids. Of his 500-plus appearances each year, 95%
involve children, from kids at the Minnesota State Fair to regular time spent with families at charities, such as Hope Day with Masonic
Children’s Hospital patients and families for bouncy houses, games and more.
He’s always eager to show off his ability to spin his head 360 degrees, especially when students or children chant for him to. Goldy is
all about improvising and playing with what’s around, whether turning his long, bushy tail into a guitar or a hockey stick into a horse –
setting an excellent example for kids to use their imaginations 24/7. His silly antics, ability to poke fun at himself and “fail” or be
“scared” in a variety of circumstances – yet still be happy and eager to try again – imparts an important lesson for kids of all ages. As
does his eagerness to cheer on people no matter what they’re doing, whether students walking to class, adults riding a bus or children
attempting an obstacle course. He celebrates snow. He celebrates sun. He celebrates rain. He’s willing to try anything (sometimes
more than once!), from water skiing to riding a scooter with his head turned backward.
On those rare moments Goldy takes a nap, UMN has two permanent statues of Goldy that people flock to. He maintains Facebook
page, Twitter, and Instagram feeds so Gopher students, alumni and Gophers-to-be (or just Goldy fans around the world) can find cheer
year-round. He not only represents the University of Minnesota, but is a symbol of and inspiration for the entire state.

148,Herbie Husker,127,01-Jan-74,,,"Herbie Husker is the oldest current mascot of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's sports teams. Herbie was created by Lubbock, Texas, artist Dirk West and first appeared on the cover of the Huskers' media guide in 1974. Soon after, he became the university's official mascot.[1]

Herbie has gone through a few makeovers, the most recent coming before the 2003 college football season. Until 2003, he was dressed in denim overalls, a red cowboy hat emblazoned with a large N, and had an ear of corn in his pocket. After the 2003 makeover, he now dons a red cowboy hat, red workshirt, blue jeans and workboots. This was done to update the overall appearance of the state's agricultural workers and general public. During halftime of the 2006 Capital One Bowl, Herbie was named National Mascot of the year for 2005.

150,Sparty,174,16-Sep-89,,,"The Original Sparty: 1955-1989
Old Sparty mascot helmet 
The first mascot appeared in 1955 and was a papier-mâché Spartan head made by Theta Xi fraternity brothers Donald Pais, Kenneth Roberts and Don Bauer. The head was six feet tall and weighed more than 60 pounds. Fraternity brother Bill Clithero was a perfect fit for the larger-than-life mascot costume. This Sparty debuted at a Jenison Field House pep rally before the Notre Dame football game.

By the 1956 Rose Bowl Game, the papier-mâché head had been replaced by a fiberglass version that was thirty pounds lighter. In 1960, the MSU student government assumed responsibility for the head. Records from that time to 1981 provide no information on who portrayed Sparty or how many years the fiberglass head was used at sporting events.

The Current Sparty: 1982-Present
Sparty at a football game
In 1985, MSU Alumni Association Executive Director Chuck Webb attended an alumni directors’ conference. There he saw a “Bucky Badger” table tent produced by the University of Wisconsin. Webb brought a sample back to East Lansing and asked Alumni Association Graphic Designer Dave Giordan to create a Spartan version. Giordan was to draw a muscular Sparty in full body armor. Based on this design, Sparty table tents were produced for use at alumni events and became a treasured keepsake.

Early in 1989, a group came together to design and revamp the Sparty mascot. Research was conducted on Michigan State’s mission, community and traditions. The result was an “approachable, fierce yet kind, man for all seasons” mascot. Sparty would reflect the university’s strength and character. To introduce MSU's new mascot, six billboards were positioned around East Lansing announcing his Spartan Stadium debut on September 16, 1989.

Since the current mascot was introduced in 1989, the MSU Alumni Association has had the honor of overseeing the Sparty Mascot Program.",0,c:\mhof\DIV-I\Big 10 Images\sparty.jpg,,3,,3,,1,Interview & try-outs,,,https://alumni.msu.edu/traditions/sparty/

The name was so popular that university board members made ""Wildcats"" the official nickname just months later.

Willie, c. 1961
In 1933, the Northwestern athletic department and an advertising firm created the first image of Willie. However, he did not come to life until 1947, when members of the Alpha Delta fraternity dressed up as him during the Homecoming parade.

The version used at basketball games and other events features Herky with different facial features and no helmet.

153,Tustedo,173,01-Jan-32,,,"Testudo, the official mascot of the University of Maryland, is not your ordinary Diamondback terrapin. For over sixty years, he has been the symbol for this campus, overseeing us in good times and bad. It is not easy work, and Testudo has experienced firsthand the dangers involved in being a source of campus pride.
Testudo got his start back in 1932, when then football coach Dr. H. Curley Byrd recommended that the Diamondback terrapin be made the school mascot. It is also the Maryland State Reptile. The suggestion was in response to The Diamondback's (the school paper, even back then) search for a new ""official"" mascot. Before this search, Maryland teams were called the Old Liners. The terrapin, a turtle native to the Chesapeake Bay, seemed a great choice and a logical one coming from Byrd. His native Crisfield, Maryland, was famous for its terrapins.

While the origin of the terrapin as school mascot is well known, why the mascot was named Testudo is more mysterious. One leading contender for the name's origin is that it was derived from the scientific classification for turtle, testudines. Another theory is that the name is from testudo gigantia, a species native to the African country Seychelles and the remote island Aldabra. Finally, the derivation of the word testudo itself comes from the Latin word for a protective shelter used for Roman soldiers heads, similar to a tortoise shell.

On the suggestion of Ralph I. Williams, president of the Student Government Association, the Class of 1933 decided to give a bronze replica of the new mascot as its graduation gift. The Class raised money for the sculpture by holding its Junior Senior German (aka the Senior Prom) on campus instead of at an expensive Washington hotel. Additional funds came from the student yearbook The Reveille (renamed The Terrapin in 1935), which was managed by Harry E. Hasslinger. Once the Class of 1933 came up with the funds for the bronze terrapin, the SGA donated money for the base.

In order to make the mascot a reality, Byrd suggested contacting Edwin C. Mayo, President of Gorham Manufacturing in Providence, RI. Mayo was a former quarterback for the University and member of the Class of 1904. He agreed to produce the 300 pound bronze terrapin at cost. Sculptor Aristide Cianfrani cast the sculpture. He used a live Diamondback as a guide, brought to Rhode Island by Ralph Williams.

On May 23, 1933, Testudo was unveiled to the world. The live terrapin used as a model had a ribbon attached to it, which was in turn attached to the canvas covering the sculpture. And as the smaller terrapin struggled forward, Testudo was revealed for the first time.

At first, Testudo had his perch in front of Ritchie Coliseum. Unfortunately, this relatively open spot soon became the scene of multiple crimes against the unguarded mascot, including painting, defacing the pedestal, and kidnapping. In 1947, when Testudo was captured by Johns Hopkins students, many Maryland students rushed to Baltimore and laid siege the building where the mascot was held. Even though 200 police were called to control the riot, the ""siege"" quickly turned into a party.

Soon after, Testudo was again snatched from his perch. Two years later, Byrd, now president of the University, received a call from a University of Virginia fraternity telling him to please get Testudo off their lawn.

With Testudo safely recovered, he was hidden in a campus carpentry shed until 1951. It had become apparent that greater security measures were needed to protect him. George O. Weber, Director of Physical Plant at College Park, and Class President for the Class of 1933 was determined to protect the campus mascot. So Testudo was filled with 700 pounds of cement and attached to his new perch in front of Byrd Stadium with long steel rods and hooks. While this put a stop to the terrapin-napping, painting was still a problem, especially by Johns Hopkins students. During one episode, Maryland students caught",0,c:\mhof\DIV-I\Big 10 Images\md.jpg,,1,,21,,1,,,,

He can also be spotted at parades and community events all around the area.  Every now and then you will even see him at other sporting events or out and about in Uptown Charlotte.  Homer's favorite activity is to show up and crash birthday parties to deliver birthday wishes... and to gobble up cake

According to brothers Gene and James Warren, who were members of the first student council at Wilmington College, the nickname was selected in 1947.  A five-man student council was convened to secure a nickname and school colors for the college's first athletic teams.

As a result, the nickname ""Seahawks"" was chosen because of the popularity of the Iowa Seahawks, a pre flight service team coached by former University of Minnesota head coach Bernie Berman.

188,Paydirt Pete,216,01-Jan-74,,,"Probably the first so-called mascot was a student dressed as a prospector leading a burro named Clyde. Some years after Clyde began making appearances at football games, then-president Dr. Joseph Ray became disenchanted with the animal's appearance. In a letter to the dean of students, Dr. Ray demanded that something be done about that ""sorry-looking, pot-bellied creature, not fit to represent the Miners."" Clyde was surveyed out in 1966 and replaced by Henry, another burro.

The name Paydirt Pete originated from a 1974 contest to give a name to the mascot. The name Paydirt Pete was selected from over 500 entries. The first animated Paydirt Pete was given a face in 1974. It was recreated in 1980. This was a lovable little ol' Miner which probably led to his being dubbed ""Sweet Pete."" At any rate, ol' Sweet Pete was not a very popular mascot and, like Clyde, he made a quick exit in order for the present Paydirt Pete to arrive on the scene.

This Paydirt Pete was meaner looking, had a major-league swagger and became something of a goodwill ambassador for the school, as well as appearing at UTEP sporting events. This Pete stuck until the late 1990s and was built and designed by El Pasoan Richard Glass. Sometime after Pete made his appearance, he decided to kick the smoking habit and the cigar, which jutted to one side of his mouth. The next rendition of Paydirt Pete was introduced in the fall of 1999, along with a brand-new UTEP athletic department logo, when again complaints surfaced similar to those against ""Sweet Pete"". In the spring of 2005, the current rendition of Paydirt Pete was unveiled at a home basketball game.

Once again, UCLA was in search of a moniker. After considering everything from Buccaneers to Gorillas, students remained in a quandary. At the time, UC Berkeley was using both Bears and Bruins. Berkeley’s student leaders voted to give the Bruin name up and finally, UCLA had its mascot.

UCLA’s earliest mascots were live bears, which entertained the home crowd at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The bears were given a variety of names, but Joe Bruin stood the test of time. In 1961, alumni presented the campus with the first Josephine Bruin, a little Himalayan bear. Josephine lived in the Rally Committee chair’s backyard, until she grew too big, and was moved to the San Diego Zoo.

Costumed student mascots took over the job in the mid-1960s. Several students were selected to take turns playing Joe, who was joined in 1967 by a costumed Josephine – or Josie, as she is more popularly called today. Joe’s costumes and depiction have evolved over the years, from a Mickey Mouse-looking Bruin in the 1930s to a smiling Joe in the 1970s. The current design was unveiled in 1996.

Joe Bruin has been on the final team for the Capital One Bowl National Mascot of the Year team four times: 2005, 2007, 2008 and 2010.",0,c:\mhof\DIV-I\pac12\joeii.jpg,,1,19,5,,1,Students audition during Spring Quarter to be a mascot for the following school year.,A team of performers,,

325,"Hink, The Bulldog",352,01-Jan-22,,,"Butler University adopted the Bulldog nickname during the 1919 football season, when ""Shimmy,"" a live english bulldog belonging to one of the fraternities began attending games.   The costumed mascot, at the time simply called ""The Butler Bulldog,"" began roaming the sidelines in 1922, with a female student donning the costume.      In the 1980s, the mascot costume was updated using a design created by the Walt Disney Company.    

The current Hink costume was acquired in 2008 after the previous version was stolen and vandalized in the summer of that year after nearly a decade of use. The case of the missing mascot costume case garnered much media and public attention which not only assisted in justice being served, but also initiated a contest to name Butlerâ€™s costumed Bulldog.

The name â€œHinkâ€ was chosen in honor of Butler legend and former athletic director, basketball, football, and baseball coach Paul D. â€œTonyâ€ Hinkle.

327,DIBS,354,01-Jan-98,,,"In 1900, DePaul’s first athletics team wore the letter ‘D’ on their uniforms. They were nicknamed the ‘D-men’ by the student body which eventually morphed into ‘Demons’. Blue and scarlet were chosen as DePaul’s colors to signify loyalty, courage, and passion. DIBS embodies these qualities that are valued by DePaul and instilled in our DePaul students.

DIBS is the iconic spirit of DePaul University and its athletics program. DIBS, which stands for Demon in Blue Suit, is loyal, faithful, and the coolest shade of blue! DIBS’ favorite place to be is where DePaul fans gather -- Wintrust Arena, McGrath-Phillips Arena, Wish Field, and Cacciatore stadium. He loves taking photos with fans, dancing on the Jumbotron, participating in contests, and cheering on our Blue Demons to a victory.

When he is not at DePaul athletics events, DIBS spends his time spreading Demon pride on campus. On Thursdays, the DePaul community is encouraged to wear blue to support our Blue Demons. DIBS takes this tradition so seriously that he joins the ‘spirit police’ in providing blue t-shirts to students on these days. DIBS is also committed to engaging with the Chicago community. He often joins our student-athletes for their volunteer opportunities and community service events. He has even designed his own program, the DIBS Summer Challenge, which rewards children with free tickets to DePaul Athletics events upon completion of fun and educational summer activities.

DIBS is a proud supporter of the DePaul ‘Wintrust Reads’ program, and like the DIBS Summer Challenge, it also encourages elementary school age children to strengthen their reading skills with the reward of free game tickets along with visiting DIBS “live” during the basketball season.

On March 3, DIBS will be celebrating his 21st birthday at this season’s Men’s Basketball Senior Day with DePaul fans and students. He has many fun activities planned, including a limited-edition tee shirt for kids and beverage promotions for adults. DIBS cannot wait to celebrate this special birthday surrounded by his beloved fans at Wintrust Arena.",0,c:\mhof\DIV-I\bigeast\dibs.jpg,,1,,24,,1,,,,

475,Big Red,540,,,,"In 1932, John Gray, as football coach and athletics director, changed Lamar University's mascot from the Brahmas to the Cardinals and the school colors from maroon and gray to red and blue. The colors changed in 1960 to red and white. A student dressed in a larger-than-life cardinal costume, affectionately known as Big Red, cheers at athletic events and represents the university at on-campus and community events. Although he has had different images throughout the years, that still hasn’t stopped him from spreading spirit on campus and throughout the community. The new and improved mascot uniform was introduced at the end of the 2011 LU football season, as he led the team onto the field. Big Red’s character can best be described as someone who likes to pump up the crowd, joke around, groove to music, and greet fans.",0,C:\MHOF\DIV-I\Southland\big red.jpg,http://www.lamarcardinals.com/sports/2017/7/12/mascots.aspx,1,4,10,21,1,,,,

521,Bucky the Pirate,528,01-Jan-91,,,"A brief history begins with a Buccaneer, who once roamed a vast area which stretched from the Florida Keys Northward. Johnson City, home of ETSU, is located among the mountains of Eastern Tennessee and is a great distance from the ocean. For this reason, one might wonder why ETSU would select a Buccaneer as their mascot. The answer is not that simple. Apparently, geologists and archaeologists teamed up and discovered an underground river near the university several years ago. Named Pirate Creek, it evidently winds its way through many subterranean tunnels. It is thought that these caverns at one time channeled all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. Soon after this discovery, the legend of buccaneer, Jean Paul LeBucque was found in history books. The legend tells that LeBucque was a nuisance and terror. Evidently, he was looking for a place to hide his great store of gold and treasure, and find safety for himself. He sailed north in search of a new home and began to look inland. Legend states that he discovered the underground river near Johnson City and called Pirate Creek his home. Geologists feel that the upheaval of the earth's crust, which now blocks the channel, possibly killed LeBucque. This legend is widely accepted and is one way to explain why an inland school would choose a pirate nickname",0,C:\MHOF\Div-I\Southern\etsu.jpg,,3,,3,,1,Formal try out,One Performer,,

After a five year sabbatical, Wally, the beloved University of Portland mascot, finally made his return to The Bluff in the summer of 2009. His first official game will be on August 28, 2009 at the Pilot women’s soccer home opener versus Cal. Since his last appearance, Wally has made several improvements to his physique in order to keep up with the other mascots around the nation (see the below photo gallery and video). However, not all this time was spent in the weight room. Wally, a Riverboat Pilot himself, took this opportunity to visit many of the hometowns of our student-athletes from around the world.

638,Weezie the Weevil,939,,,,"Any cotton farmer will tell you that the Boll Weevil, a cotton-eating beetle, is nothing to be messed with. Native to central Mexico, the beetle made its way to the southern United States in the late 1800s and by 1920 was wreaking havoc on cotton farms across the U.S. The beetle is devastating and infestation can happen quickly. That’s exactly the message UAM’s President Horsfall was trying to send when he announced the mascot at a pep rally in 1925.

UAM was gearing up to play Magnolia A&M, a southern farm school later know as Southern Arkansas University. Horsfall wanted to send a message that UAM meant business. He told students “The only gosh-darned thing that ever licked the South was the boll weevil. Boll weevils! That’s what you are – Boll Weevils!”

The Boll Weevil has been picked on over the years and has made many lists of strange and unusual mascots. Boll Weevil pride runs strong at UAM and even the rivals have to smile a little at that first sighting of Weezie the Weevil.",0,C:\MHOF\DIV-II\GreatAmerican\uam.jpg,,1,,23,,1,,,,

661,Orion,964,29-Aug-15,,,"SPRINGFIELD, Ill. - The University of Illinois Springfield Department of Athletics announced that ""Orion"" would be the new Prairie Star mascot. Orion replaces Cozmo who retired in May.

""I am excited to introduce Orion as the new Prairie Stars mascot,"" said Director of Athletics Kim Pate. ""He brings an element of strength, offers creative opportunities and is synonymous with the Prairie Stars nickname. It is my hope that Orion will continue to help us strengthen our athletics identity while energizing student, campus, and community pride.""

The Prairie Star nickname dates to 1977 and is the brainchild of John Watts, godfather of soccer in Springfield. When Sangamon State University, as it was known then, decided to field sports teams, soccer was first. An athletic committee was formed to take suggestions for nicknames. In total 120 suggestions came in and the committee narrowed down to six finalists and put them up for a vote and Prairie Stars won. The name was meant to signify athletic excellence - ""stars - on the flat, prairie-side fields of the southeastern part of Springfield.

In spring 2015, UIS embarked on a process to identify a new mascot that would resemble strength, provide creative opportunities, and would be relevant to the nickname ""Prairie Stars"". As a result of campus engagement and feedback, a mascot committee made of up of broad student representation recommended strong consideration of Orion, the ""great hunter"" to be selected as the new mascot. 

Orion, the son of Neptune, is noted in Greek history and mythology as the greatest hunter to have ever lived. Tales of his physical stature and hunting skill preceded him wherever he traveled. Some thought him mortal, some thought him a gift from the Gods, and others believed he must be born of the Gods themselves. With his lion cloak and star tipped mace he traveled the world besting both beast and man. For his prowess he was immortalized in the stars and remains one of the most prominent and recognizable constellations around the world. Orion can be seen looking down on UIS from the prairie sky poised to attack any foe that should dare enter his hunting grounds.
 
""I want to thank those that participated in the process of identifying a new mascot and specifically thank Charlie Schweighauser, UIS Professor Emeritus of English, Astronomy & Physics for providing us the background on Greek mythology and astronomy relevant to Orion in order to portray him as authentic as possible.""

Over the years he has cheered the Hilltoppers to victories and championships, toured the streets of South Congress in Austin, Texas, and has become the most beloved moutain goat in all the Hill Country. As a champion for the university and the city, Topper has always vowed to honor any public appearance request that his schedule allows (see link above), and throughout the school year you can find him at the fields, courts or around campus at many of St. Edward's student-life events. Indeed, Topper the mascot is one-of-a-kind and has yet to be matched.",0,C:\MHOF\DIV-II\Heartland\topper.jpg,http://www.gohilltoppers.com/sports/2016/7/25/tooper-the-mascot.aspx,1,,14,,1,,,,

774,Regal the Eagle,1082,01-Jan-96,,,"When the University of Minnesota, Crookston  changed its mission to offer baccalaureate level degree programs in 1993, the campus entered a new chapter in its history.  Many among the campus community believed a new team name and mascot should be chosen to signify that important change.  A campus-wide discussion began.  Students, staff, faculty, and alumni shared their thoughts and ideas for names.  Some suggested names included the Pride, Northstars, Trailblazers, the Storm, and the Phoenix among others.  Faculty within the Natural Resources Program suggested the name Golden Eagles, and that name resonated with the campus community.  

On November 27, 1995, at a Teambackers Banquet, the University of Minnesota, Crookston announced that a new name had been chosen for its athletics teams.  The original design of the logo and mascot image was done by Del Wright, who worked in Media Services at that time.  Soon after, a contest to name the Golden Eagle took place, and students, faculty, and staff submitted 66 different names for consideration.  From those names a committee selected the name Regal, meaning “of great magnificence, splendid.”  And so Regal the Golden Eagle was born.  The winning name was submitted by Trevor Brekken, a plant industries management major from Crookston.  The new Golden Eagles name, logo, and mascot were launched for all teams beginning in the fall of 1996.

In 2001, Regal received a facelift when University Relations began work with AdMonkeys, a regional graphics and advertising agency.  The various athletics teams, the Crookston Student Association, and other student groups, along with faculty and staff, all played a role in refining the look of the official logo.  Several revisions later, the current look of the logo of the Golden Eagles was adopted.  As soon after, Regal the Golden Eagle mascot began appearing at games and across campus on Maroon and Gold Fridays.  Regal proudly stands with Goldy Gopher from the Twin Cities campus; Pounce, the Morris Cougar; and Champ, the Duluth Bulldog.",0,C:\MHOF\DIV-II\Northern Sun\regal.jpg,http://www.goldeneaglesports.com/sports/2011/1/23/regal.aspx,1,,10,23,1,,,,

1579,Thunder the Dog,1590,01-Apr-01,,,"When it comes to fun in the Inland Valley, you have to mention Thunder The Dog. Thunder or ""The Big Green Dog"" as many call him. The official mascot of the Lake Elsinore Storm professional baseball, Thunder is the larger-than-life bright-green fur-covered pooch that always loves to be the life of the party.

Thunder is the self-proclaimed California League Mascot of the Year, 18 seasons running, and 2010 & 2011 GameOps.com Mascot of the Year. A very special hound, Thunder is one of only a few members of the ""Canis Thunderus"" family. He is known for his ability to stand upright, walk on the tops of chairs, dance, drive quads, and generally just act a fool. He has a beautiful coat of green fur and wears one of the world's largest pair of shoes. As anyone can see he loves his food, just look at his belly.

Thunder first debuted as the primary mascot for the Storm in 2001, taking the place of former Storm mascot Hamlet. And has been a crowd favorite in Lake Elsinore since. Hamlet still comes out for special occasions from time-to-time, but Thunder is the star of the show nowadays. You can find the lovable canine at all Storm home games in the stands and on the field sharing his antics with fans, players and umpires alike. When he's not at the Diamond you can find Thunder all around the Inland Empire spreading the Storm spirit as he makes over 300 community appearances every year. Some of Thunder's favorite appearances include birthday parties, holiday parades, grand openings and school assemblies. Thunder will go just about anywhere if bribed with food.

The Express were just getting started and needed someone to help entertain all the fans. Whether it is taking pictures, leading the Kids Club on the field for parades or pulling a prank or two, Spike always brings the fun to every Express home game. When he doesn't have his paws in the community, he is leading rallies in the bottom of the ninth inning or teaching someone how to floss on the dugouts, all in the time it takes most dogs to chew a bone.

We are not a school, but our primary performer was the Sam Houston Bearcats mascot and then moved up to Dynamo Diesel. 

Fiber Works created our current suit but we are wokring with Alinco Costumes for our new suit.

Performer does not know about this (want it to be a surprise). Please contact Kris Rigby

Since he joined the team, Diesel has been a huge presence in the Houston community, with some of his efforts including: â€œDieselâ€™s Toy Chestâ€ benefiting B.I.G Love Cancer Care, â€œDieselâ€™s Championsâ€ motivational education programs, riding in the MS 150 and even swam over 500 meters to raise money for Big Brothers Big Sisters-Houston!",0,C:\MHOF\MLS\fox.jpg,https://www.houstondynamo.com/fans/diesel,1,26,29,,1,Recommendation.

1701,Timber Joey,1708,01-Jan-08,,,"There was a Timber Jim first, also human.

History of the Log Slab Tradition:
“No, you can’t bring any chainsaws in the stands. Are you crazy?” That’s what former Timbers general manager Keith Williams said to Jim Serrill back in the late 1970s. At the time, little did Williams know that Serrill would become the team’s long-time icon as “Timber Jim” and that his saw would establish a unique and beloved Timbers tradition – the cutting of the “log slab.” After each goal scored by the Timbers at Providence Park, a slice is cut from the victory log behind the north goal and celebrated in a cloud of sawdust and cheered by the roar of a chainsaw and thousands of voices. The log slab is then paraded through the stands, and ultimately, presented to its rightful owner – the goal scorer – in a post-game ceremony. This time-honored tradition has helped make Timbers matches at Providence Park a one-of-a-kind soccer experience in the United States. Over the years, the players have changed, the uniforms have changed, and even the mascot has changed, but the tradition of cutting the log slab after each Timbers goal lives on, and the spirit of the “log slab” will continue to inspire Timbers fans for years to come.",0,C:\MHOF\MLS\joey.jpg,https://www.timbers.com/providencepark/supporters/timber-joey,4,,3,,1,,,,

1793,Ace The Fastest Squirrel,1590,01-Apr-12,,,"Ace recently hung up the racing spikes after his final full season in 2017, but his legacy will live on. After years of being chased by too many dogs (*cough* Thunder *cough*), Ace decided to race baseball fans for six seasons.

Named for his sponsor, The Lake Elsinore Hotel and Casino, Ace raced fans from foul pole to foul pole regularly during Storm home games at The Diamond. Each contestant had a chance to win $500 if they upset the heavily favored rodent in a race across the field. You can count the number of Ace's losses on one hand, but the number of victories is in the hundreds.

The nutty and speedy squirrel began his career with the Lake Elsinore Storm in 2012 and gained notoriety after making his Major League debut at Petco Park in San Diego and earning a spot on SportsCenter's Top 10 plays of the day. The Giants had a 5-0 lead in the fourth inning over the Padres when Ace was called into action. After giving his unsuspecting opponent a huge lead, the ""World's Fastest Squirrel"" lived up to his name by rallying to win the race by about 10 meters. The Padres went on to score six runs that inning and win the game. Padres Manager Bud Black mentioned the Squirrel Race in a post-game interview as the turning point in the game for the team. After that, Ace became part of a national advertising campaign for ESPN.",0,C:\MHOF\Milb\California League\ace.jpg,,1,15,40,,1,,,,

1894,Pops,187,,,,"Born: 1934

Place of Birth: Unknown - found near train tracks in Syracuse as an infant

Occupation: Retired Engineer

Hobbies: Taking naps, dancing when things get exciting (the Mac-arena is one of his favorites), keeping his mustache well groomed

Personality: Old man-ish, a little insecure (Scooch is helping him out)

Background Information: In 1934, just after the completion of MacArthur Stadium a little bundle was found on the side of the railroad tracks in Syracuse. An engineer brought his train to a halt and picked up the bundle and was surprised to see not only a baby, but a baby with a baseball for a head.

Not sure what to do with him, the engineer decided to raise the child and named him Mac Arthur after the new Syracuse Baseball Stadium. As a child Mac would watch the Chiefs games every night from far beyond the outfield fence, away from people's sight. He loved the smell of the ballpark's green grass, the players - Hank Sauer, Mack Jones, and Carlos Delgado - and later Scooch the Chiefs mascot.

When he grew up he became an engineer himself and he would always blow the train whistle when he drove by the stadium. Now 73, Mac who was nicknamed ""Pops"" by his fellow engineers, is retired from the railroad and is ready to enjoy his golden years by spending time at Alliance Bank Stadium and becoming part of the Chiefs family and a good friend to Scooch.",0,C:\MHOF\milb\International League\Pops.jpg,,3,,8,,1,,,,

Hamlet's name comes from the Shakespeare play Hamlet where the setting is where else, but Elsinore. 

Hamlet's backstory comes from the legend of the Lake Elsinore Monster, or just Elsie or Hamlet or "" The lake monster of Lake Elsinore.""
Sightings and descriptions of the creature date back over 100 years
1884 - An enormous sea serpent was spotted at the lake.
1934 - Sighting by C.B. Greenstreet - fast 100 feet long creature with 30 feet long tail. It was the sighting that gave the monster two names - Elsie and Hamlet, and made it famous.
1967 - A famlily saw a dark creature with humps.
1970 - Sighting by Bonne Play - she saw Elsie two times. It's a 12 feet long saurian-looking creature with humps. Some time later, 3 state park officials saw the creature swimming 50 feet away from their boat, it had 3 or 4 humps with spines.
There were few sightings in 1992.
1993 - A man saw 15 feet long, whale-looking creature.
1994 - A fisherman claimed that hooked the creature, at first he thought it was a log, but as he pulled he saw an alligator-like head. The beast broke the line and swam away.",0,C:\MHOF\Milb\California League\hamlet.jpg,,1,,18,,0,Hiring Process,,,

1955,Buddy the Puffin,1788,18-Oct-92,,,"The American Hockey League came to St. John’s, the most easterly point of North America in 1991, as the affiliate to the Toronto Maple Leafs. The St. John’s Maple Leafs unvieled their mascot Buddy the Puffin at the start of the teams second season October 1992. The Puffin is the provincial bird and the name “Buddy” is so synonymous with Newfoundland culture. Buddy wore a St. John’s Maple Leafs jersey sporting the number 92 reflecting the year he entered the league. The original performer was there for two and half seasons and I took over when he quit. The leafs eventually left Newfoundland in 2005 to be closer to the parent club in Toronto. From 2005-2008 the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League occupied the vacancy of the Leafs with the new jr. team St. John’s Fogdevils. I wasn’t their teams mascot. The AHL made its way back to the island in 2011, but only stuck around for six seasons. Four seasons as the Winnipeg Jets farm team and two as the Montreal Canadiens. I was asked to be part the St. John’s Icecaps as their mascot and Buddy the Puffin was taken out of retirement. Once again the league left the capital city leaving a vanacy of pro hockey for just one year. In its absence a minor pro basketball league filled the void, no mascot for use for the St. John’s Edge in its inaugural season of the National Basketball League of Canada. With just a year with no hockey, the East Coast Hockey League was welcomed with open arms into a city who has now become something of a sports town, known before as a hockey town. The Newfoundland Growlers began play in October of 2018 and welcome Buddy the Puffin as the teams mascot. A month later, the Edge also introduced Buddy as their team cheerleader. I have been performing the character of Buddy the Puffin since the 27th day of December 1994. Over 700 games, in 18 seasons, three hockey clubs and a basketball team over a span of 25 years. I’ve done over three thousand and more outside appearances for private functions, corporate sponsor events, Birthday party’s and special events. I have attended Many AHL all star weekends and even had a opportunity to perform on the big stage in the NHL. Each March the AHL would have a fan poll on their Facebook page, to vote on who was the leagues best mascot. I consider myself one of the best ones in the league along side the many others who do what I do. I won the popularity contest in two occasions in 2013 and ‘17. This has been the utmost amazing job I ever had. I don’t think of it as a job, it’s like living another identity and the freedom to be anybody I want to be without judgement. I’ve met some amazing individuals, too many to mention. One in particular I will mention has made it his mission to make it to the big leagues. Most kids want to be pro hockey players or athletes, while other kids would rather be the person singing the anthem , or driving the Zamboni. Chad Spencer made it his mission and is now a member of the Edmonton Oilers. Chad made his statement with his alter ego “Tux”, with the Wilkes-Barre Scranton Penguins, the affiliate to the Pittsburgh Penguins. When I first met him he spoke of his drive to eventually one day work in the NHL. Now Chad is the new mascot for the Edmonton Oilers. Not sure when I’ll retire, but how do you retire from a position you love. I wake up the morning after a game thinking a freight train had hit me. Whether I’m an ageless wonder or a sucker for punishment, seeing the smiles on people’s faces, the laughter from children and the respect from the players I’m supporting night in and night out. It takes a special person to do what we do, it also takes a boat load of patience. Make one thing certain, it’s a job I’ll always be proud of and will continue to respect the name on the back as my own and work hard for the team I represent no matter what crest I have worn.

The three larger-than-life Oakland Hall of Famers are just some of the more recent characters to join the mascot race phenomenon that has taken over Major League Baseball. Fingers, Eckersley, and Henderson joined the company of pierogis, sea creatures, hardware tools, soft drinks, hot sauce packets, U.S. presidents, and, of course, the famous Milwaukee sausages who all race around ballparks for the amusement and entertainment of fans.

While it is all fun and games, for the most part, these casts of characters have truly broken the mold of the traditional mascot. While they still spend plenty of time hovering in the stands and posing for silly photos, mascots across baseball have become more physically active than ever in how they entertain spectators.

Oaklandâ€™s inaugural Hall of Fame race was held on August 3, 2013, and was won by none other than the speedy Rickey Henderson. While it may seem like a no-brainer to put your money on the all-time stolen base leader, it turns out that baseball statistics mean very little when it comes to three people sprinting 250 yards in 10-foot-tall, 50-pound costumes. The mascots combat physical exhaustion, lack of visibility, profuse sweating, rowdy hecklers, and most importantly, the fear and embarrassment of toppling over.

The American Association is one of the great names in the history of professional baseball leagues in the United States. The first American Association was formed in 1902 as an independent minor league for the larger cities in the midwestern area of the U.S. The original members of the league were the St. Paul Apostles, the Minneapolis Millers, the Kansas City Cowboys, the Toledo Mud Hens, the Indianapolis Indians, the Louisville Colonels, the Milwaukee Brewers, and the Columbus (OH) Senators. The following year (1903), the American Association joined the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues (the minor league organization), and for the next half century the league was arguably the most influential minor league in all of baseball. Great players such as Ted Williams, Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays and more starred in league ballparks, and the Junior World Series was a major event in the U.S. sporting world. In 1944 more than 50,000 fans showed up for a crucial JWS game between Louisville and Baltimore.

In 2018, the American Association stretches from Canada all the way to southern Texas and as far east as Indiana. Manitoba, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Texas, Minnesota, Iowa, and Indiana are all represented in the 12-team league, which will feature two divisions.

The top two teams from each division will meet in the best-of-5 semifinals, with the winners meeting in the best-of-5 championship series.
